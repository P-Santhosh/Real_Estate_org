        <p className="text-xl font-semibold pt-5">Document Clearance</p>
        <p>
          Always do a legal clearance before buying a property. Ensure that the
          property is free from hassles and no complications will occur in
          future. Go through the buyer seller agreement carefully.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl font-semibold pt-5">Basic Infrastructure</p>
        <p>
          Without basic needs we canâ€™t survive in a locality. So check for
          availability of water and ground water level in the location. Check
          how often power cuts happen in the surroundings.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl font-semibold pt-5">Resale Value</p>
        <p>
          Always go for the land with future values. Many factors determine the
          value of land like schools, colleges, industrial estates, etc. near
          the buying location. So choose wisely.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl font-semibold pt-5">RERA Registered</p>
        <p>
          Government approved product is good for us in any situation, likewise
          buy the RERA registered flats which protects you from structural
          defects.
